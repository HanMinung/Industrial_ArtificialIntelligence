* Purpose : Analysis of recent trends in industrial data analysis and research on machine learning and deep learning



â€‹			This repository introduces the process of analyzing industrial data, including vibration and acceleration data generated from rotating equipment, and diagnosing failures. The biggest issues in recent industrial data are as follows.

* Poor model application performance between different domains 
* Accordingly, domain adaptation learning and contrastive learning are big issues.

First, the final goal is to study the processes of how data is preprocessed and learned using the KAMP dataset, and then mainly deal with issues.

The table of contents of the repository is as follows.

1. KAMP dataset study
